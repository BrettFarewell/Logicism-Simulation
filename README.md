# Logic Circuit Simulation - Personal Project

## Application Use & Purpose - Project Discription

The *Logic Circuit Simulation* is an application where users can design and test their logic circuits. Thus, users will be able to place logic gates (e.g. OR Gate, NOR Gate, AND Gate, NOT Gate, etc.), outputs (e.g. light bulb, speaker), and a source (power), then interconnect them via drawable wires. *Logic Circuit Simulation* will serve as an educational tool, allowing individuals to learn more about logic circuits and the fundamentals that computers use for computations.


As mentioned, *Logic Circuit Simulation* is designed for individuals who want to experiment and educate themselves on the building blocks of digital circuits in a simulated hands-on environment. Additionally, the project interests me as I recently have been partaking in the  Maple Bacon club, a club dedicated to capture the flag (CTF) hacking competitions. Thus, I want to gain a better knowledge and understanding of computer architecture and logical circuits, to educate myself on computer hardware vulnerabilities.
