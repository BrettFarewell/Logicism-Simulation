# Logic Circuit Simulation - Personal Project

## Application Use & Purpose - Project Discription

The *Logic Circuit Simulation* is an application where users can design and test their logic circuits. Thus, users will be able to place logic gates (e.g. OR Gate, NOR Gate, AND Gate, NOT Gate, etc.), outputs (e.g. light bulb, speaker, etc.), and a source (power), then interconnect them via drawable wires. *Logic Circuit Simulation* will serve as an educational tool, allowing individuals to learn more about logic circuits and the fundamentals that computers use for computations. users will be able to create a blank scenario in which they can draw out their desired logical circuits and then run them in real-time.


As mentioned, *Logic Circuit Simulation* is designed for individuals who want to experiment and educate themselves on the building blocks of digital circuits in a simulated hands-on environment. Additionally, the project interests me as I recently have been partaking in the  Maple Bacon club, a club dedicated to capture the flag (CTF) hacking competitions. Thus, I want to gain a better knowledge and understanding of computer architecture and logical circuits, to educate myself on computer hardware vulnerabilities.


## User Stories

List of **User Stories**:
- As a user, I want to be able to create a scenario (blank world state) and add it to a list of scenarios.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a scenario (blank world state), then add and draw any number of logical gates, outputs, sources, and wires to said scenario.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a scenario from a list of scenarios I have created.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all logical gates and outputs added to a scenario.
- As a user, I want to be able to draw wires to interconnect logic gates, sources, and outputs and run them in real-time to create a functioning logic circuit.
- As a user, I want to be able to select the OR gate, NOR gate, AND gate, NAND gate, NOT gate, XOR gate, or XNOR gate from a menu and then have the menu tell me what the gate does.
- As a user, I want to have a light source and an audio source that plays a frequency as outputs and I want to be able to select the colour or frequency at which the output emits.

- As a user, I want the option to save the current application state with the list of all scenarios when the I quit the application
- As a user, I want the option to load a previously saved application state that contains a list of scenarios when the I start the application
